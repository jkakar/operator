      badges_message: >-
        If your plugin's Git repository will be hosted on GitHub, build status and code coverage
        badges can be automatically added to your README.
      badges_question: >-

      github_user_question: What is your GitHub username?
      badges_reminder: >-

        GitHub. Additionally, you will need to configure the project on Travis CI and Coveralls.io.
      minimum_ruby_version: >-
        Lita 6.0 will require Ruby %{required_version} or greater. You are currently using version
        %{current_version} and should upgrade when you can.
      no_default_handlers: |
        In Lita 5.0, the default handlers were moved to a separate gem called lita-default-handlers.
        Lita 5 has a hard dependency on this gem, so all the default handlers will continue to load
        by default. However, in Lita 6.0, the default handlers will only be loaded if you explicitly
        include the gem in your Lita project's Gemfile. You can do this now by adding the following
        line to your Lita project's Gemfile:

          gem "lita-default-handlers"
    config:
      exception: |

        WARNING: In Lita %{version}, the following behavior will change:

          %{description}
      error_handler_metadata:
        Custom error handlers (config.robot.error_handler) will take a second argument, a hash of
        additional metadata about the context in which the error occurred.
      flag_removal_warning: >-
        WARNING: Object `%{object_name}` explicitly enables the feature "%{name}", but this behavior
        is the default as of Lita %{version_default}. You should remove `feature :%{name}` from the
        object now, because it will be removed completely and cause an error in Lita
        %{version_removed}.
      opt_in_warning: >-
        To opt-in to the new behavior now, add this code to the object `%{object_name}`:

           feature :%{name}
