# hal9000

Hal reincarnated as a Lita bot. Lita is stable, maintained, and written in Ruby.

## Development

Hal9000 encourages the use of [devenv](https://git.dev.pardot.com/Pardot/devenv). After installing devenv, run:

```bash
devenv compose up
```

In another shell, connect to the bot:

```bash
devenv compose run bot
```

You should be connect to an interactive session with Hal9000:

```
Type "exit" or "quit" to end the session.
Hal >
```

If everything worked, you can type `!help`:

```
Hal > !help
Hal: help - Lists help information for terms and command the robot will respond to.
```
