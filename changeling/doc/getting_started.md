# Getting started with Changeling

## For teams

- [ ] Review your team's components in [Component Inventory](https://heroku.my.salesforce.com), ensuring that:
  - [ ] Lifecycle status is set appropriately
  - [ ] The repository is a fully-qualified GitHub URL (e.g. https://github.com/heroku/changeling)
  - [ ] Component owners are correct
  - [ ] Heroku apps are correct
- [ ] Ensure your GitHub username is correct in [employees.csv](https://github.com/heroku/changeling/blob/master/config/employees.csv). If not, email vibehelp@ to get it corrected and let us know.
- [ ] Ensure your email address in [employees.csv](https://github.com/heroku/changeling/blob/master/config/employees.csv) matches your email address in Component Inventory.
- [ ] Set an alerts room in [Heimdall](https://github.com/heroku/heimdall/blob/master/repositories.json) so Changeling can alert you when one of your apps changes (see the 'tools' entry for an example).
- [ ] Add your team's [repositories](https://dataclips.heroku.com/gxsqmyzklvorpjpskndnsmdoejhe-All-production-components-by-team) to [repositories.json](https://github.com/heroku/changeling/blob/master/config/repositories.json) by submitting a PR.
