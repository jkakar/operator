  Provides a AWS Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream

# aws\_kinesis\_firehose\_delivery\_stream

Provides a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream resource. Amazon Kinesis Firehose is a fully managed, elastic service to easily deliver real-time data streams to destinations such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

For more details, see the [Amazon Kinesis Firehose Documentation][1].

## Example Usage

### S3 Destination
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "tf-test-bucket"
  acl = "private"
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "firehose_role" {
   name = "firehose_test_role"
   assume_role_policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "firehose.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Sid": ""
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream" "test_stream" {
  name = "terraform-kinesis-firehose-test-stream"
  destination = "s3"
  s3_configuration {
    role_arn = "${aws_iam_role.firehose_role.arn}"
    bucket_arn = "${aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn}"
  }
}
```

### Redshift Destination

```
resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "test_cluster" {
  cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster-%d"
  database_name = "test"
  master_username = "testuser"
  master_password = "T3stPass"
  node_type = "dc1.large"
  cluster_type = "single-node"
}

resource "aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream" "test_stream" {
  name = "terraform-kinesis-firehose-test-stream"
  destination = "redshift"
  s3_configuration {
    role_arn = "${aws_iam_role.firehose_role.arn}"
    bucket_arn = "${aws_s3_bucket.bucket.arn}"
    buffer_size = 10
    buffer_interval = 400
    compression_format = "GZIP"
  }
  redshift_configuration {
    role_arn = "${aws_iam_role.firehose_role.arn}"
    cluster_jdbcurl = "jdbc:redshift://${aws_redshift_cluster.test_cluster.endpoint}/${aws_redshift_cluster.test_cluster.database_name}"
    username = "testuser"
    password = "T3stPass"
    data_table_name = "test-table"
    copy_options = "GZIP"
    data_table_columns = "test-col"
  }
}
```

~> **NOTE:** Kinesis Firehose is currently only supported in us-east-1, us-west-2 and eu-west-1.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A name to identify the stream. This is unique to the
AWS account and region the Stream is created in.
* `destination` â€“ (Required) This is the destination to where the data is delivered. The only options are `s3` & `redshift`.
* `s3_configuration` - (Required) Configuration options for the s3 destination (or the intermediate bucket if the destination
is redshift). More details are given below.
* `redshift_configuration` - (Optional) Configuration options if redshift is the destination. 
Using `redshift_configuration` requires the user to also specify a
`s3_configuration` block. More details are given below.

The `s3_configuration` object supports the following:

* `role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the AWS credentials.
* `bucket_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the S3 bucket
* `prefix` - (Optional) The "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" time format prefix is automatically used for delivered S3 files. You can specify an extra prefix to be added in front of the time format prefix. Note that if the prefix ends with a slash, it appears as a folder in the S3 bucket
* `buffer_size` - (Optional) Buffer incoming data to the specified size, in MBs, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 5.
                                We recommend setting SizeInMBs to a value greater than the amount of data you typically ingest into the delivery stream in 10 seconds. For example, if you typically ingest data at 1 MB/sec set SizeInMBs to be 10 MB or higher.
* `buffer_interval` - (Optional) Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before delivering it to the destination. The default value is 300.
* `compression_format` - (Optional) The compression format. If no value is specified, the default is NOCOMPRESSION. Other supported values are GZIP, ZIP & Snappy. If the destination is redshift you cannot use ZIP or Snappy.
* `kms_key_arn` - (Optional) If set, the stream will encrypt data using the key in KMS, otherwise, no encryption will
be used.

The `redshift_configuration` object supports the following:

* `cluster_jdbcurl` - (Required) The jdbcurl of the redshift cluster.
* `username` - (Required) The username that the firehose delivery stream will assume. It is strongly recommend that the username and password provided is used exclusively for Amazon Kinesis Firehose purposes, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT permissions.
* `password` - (Required) The passowrd for the username above.
* `role_arn` - (Required) The arn of the role the stream assumes.
* `data_table_name` - (Required) The name of the table in the redshift cluster that the s3 bucket will copy to.
* `copy_options` - (Optional) Copy options for copying the data from the s3 intermediate bucket into redshift.
* `data_table_columns` - (Optional) The data table columns that will be targeted by the copy command.

## Attributes Reference

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the Stream
